# switch-consolidation
Solo development that I did at a previous career to automate consolidation of information on Cisco Switches.

Takes in a csv file with switch stack information: IPaddr and Host Name

Generates a report based on the description of each port

Consolidates all reports into one report to be reviewed

Examples - Redacted any client information:
Report on single switch stack
